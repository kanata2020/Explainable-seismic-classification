# Explainable-seismic-classification

## Overview
This repository focuses on seismic signal classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for identifying earthquake, micro-earthquake, rockfall, and noise events. The project includes pre-trained CNN models in the model folder, datasets for testing classification performance in the data folder, and Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating classification results and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) examples in the example folder.

## Model
The model folder contains pre-trained CNN models ready for use. These models can be loaded and employed for classification tasks without the need for extensive training.

## Data
The data folder includes datasets that can be used to assess the performance of the pre-trained models. Feel free to use these datasets to test the classification accuracy.

## Example
The example folder provides Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) files that showcase the classification results and offer examples of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). 
These notebooks are designed to help users understand how to use the pre-trained models and generate LRP maps.
